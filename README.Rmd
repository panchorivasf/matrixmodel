The goal of the Indiana Forest Simulator (AKA matrixmodel) is to provide Indiana foresters with a tool to simulate forest stocks in the State into the future.

## Installation

You can install the development version of matrixmodel from [GitHub](https://github.com/) by typing the following in the R console:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("panchorivasf/matrixmodel")
```

Once the package is installed, load it into `R` with:

```{r example}
library(matrixmodel)
```

To start, you need to search for a CSV file in the 'matrix model' format and import it into `R`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
setwd("path/to/your/folder")


```
