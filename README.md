The goal of the `matrixmodel` package is to provide tools to forecast
forest stocks. The forecasting functions take data in the “matrix model”
format for tree plot surveys, either CSV or R data frames, to compute
simulations for each species group.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `matrixmodel` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) by typing the following in the R console:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("panchorivasf/matrixmodel")
# Follow instructions 
```

Once the package is installed, load it into `R` with:

``` r
library(matrixmodel)
```
